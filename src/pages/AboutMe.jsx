          Hello! I'm a test engineer that has recently become a web developer that is passionate about building interactive and
          user-friendly web applications. I have experience with React, JavaScript,
          and modern front-end technologies. I also have experience with C++ and Python along with other embedded languages.
          I love solving problems and creating efficient solutions. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading books,
          and exploring new technologies. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges.
          Let's connect and create something amazing together!
